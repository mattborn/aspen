    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      Aspen is part of the Ivy Correctional Medicine family, extending Ivy’s
      proven, in-facility standard of care to smaller jails through specialized
      telehealth. While Ivy has spent 14 years serving facilities with 100–800
      beds, Aspen was built for those with 10–80 beds—bringing daily nursing,
      weekly provider and mental health sessions, 24/7 on-call support, and full
      medical administrative management.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result: healthier inmates, reduced liability, and deputies free to
      focus on security.

    <h2>Aspen: Built on the Expertise of Ivy Correctional Medicine</h2>
    <p>
      Aspen is part of the Ivy Correctional Medicine family, created to bring
      the same trusted approach to healthcare in corrections to a new kind of
      challenge. Ivy has been providing comprehensive, in-facility medical care
      to county jails for 14 years, typically serving facilities between 100 and
      800 beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that time, we’ve earned a reputation for delivering consistent,
      high-quality healthcare in the complex environment of a correctional
      facility. Counties rely on us because we understand how to integrate
      medical care into secure operations—protecting inmate health while
      reducing liability and supporting jail staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in our work, we saw a gap: smaller jails, especially those with 10 to
      80 beds, often lack access to dedicated, professional medical teams.
      Without that resource, counties have greater liability exposure, officer
      burnout, and uneven care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aspen was created to fill that gap. Built from the ground up to deliver
      Ivy’s proven standard of care, Aspen brings the expertise honed over years
      of in-facility service to the unique needs of smaller, more isolated
      jails.
    </p>
    <p>With Aspen, jails get:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily nursing sessions for general and chronic care needs</li>
      <li>
        Weekly provider visits for diagnosis, treatment, and medication
        management
      </li>
      <li>Weekly mental health sessions for assessment and support</li>
      <li>24/7 access to nursing and prescriber support for urgent needs</li>
      <li>
        Full administrative ownership of medical tasks, freeing deputies to
        focus on security
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple: protect inmates, lower county liability, reduce
      costly medical transports, and make sure that even the smallest facilities
      can access professional, corrections-appropriate healthcare.
