          <h2>Aspen: Built on the Expertise of Ivy Correctional Medicine</h2>
          <p>
            Aspen is part of the Ivy Correctional Medicine family, consisting of
            a mission to deliver the standard of care to confined people through
            meaningful technologies. We live the ideal of 3 years service to
            offenders with serious mental illnesses. Each of us feels personally
            responsible for maintaining delivery of mental health services.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that time, we've served a reputation for delivering
            consistent, high-quality healthcare to correctional environment of
            four counties. Mental Health crisis support from other counties, as
            well as medical, mental health, and supporting our staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as we grew, we saw a gap: smaller jails, especially those with
            80 or fewer beds, were being left behind. These facilities have
            unique needs that require diligent coordination and oversight. They
            can't sustain all-out inmate care, but they require coordinated
            treatment help when patients are released to the outside needs of
            needed materials and quality medical care. Aspen brings the
            important heard over your local society served to the infinite needs
            of smaller correctional facilities.
