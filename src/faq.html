        <summary>Do we need special technology to use Aspen?</summary>
        <p>
          No special technology is required. Aspen works with standard internet
          connections and basic video calling equipment that most facilities
          already have or can easily obtain.
        </p>

        <summary>
          What happens when an inmate complains about a medical issue?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Your staff contacts Aspen immediately. Our medical team triages the
          complaint and determines the appropriate level of care, taking the
          decision-making burden off your officers.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What if our internet is unreliable?</summary>
        <p>
          Aspen is designed to work with typical jail internet connections. We
          provide backup protocols and can work with your IT team to optimize
          connectivity for telehealth services.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What kinds of medical services do you provide?</summary>
        <p>
          Aspen provides comprehensive medical care including daily nursing
          triage, weekly provider visits, behavioral health sessions, 24/7
          on-call access, suicide evaluations, and all administrative
          coordination.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can we keep our local nurse/provider?</summary>
        <p>
          Aspen is designed as a complete replacement for on-site medical staff.
          Our telehealth model provides more reliable coverage than traditional
          on-site arrangements.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do we still pay for medications?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes, facilities are responsible for medication costs. However, Aspen’s
          corrections-specialized approach typically reduces medication expenses
          by 20-50% through appropriate prescribing practices.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          Do you offer part-time, in-person nursing or providers?
        </summary>
        <p>
          No. Aspen’s strength is our fully telehealth model that provides 24/7
          coverage without the vulnerabilities of part-time or on-site
          arrangements.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          My jail is bigger than 100 beds, do you have services for larger
          jails?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Aspen is specifically designed for jails under 80 beds. For larger
          facilities, we recommend exploring vendors that specialize in larger
          jail operations.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          What if I have more than 100 beds, but fewer than 80 inmates on
          average?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Aspen evaluates each facility based on average daily population, not
          bed count. If your ADP consistently stays under 80, we can discuss
          whether Aspen is a good fit.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What does this cost?</summary>
        <p>
          Pricing varies based on facility size and specific needs. Contact us
          for a customized quote that compares costs to your current medical
          arrangements.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What does implementation look like?</summary>
        <p>
          Implementation is fast. Medical support begins on day one, with full
          telehealth sessions starting within the first week. Our team handles
          all setup and staff training.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Who does MedPass?</summary>
        <p>
          Your facility staff continues to handle medication distribution. Aspen
          manages prescribing, medication review, and all clinical
          decision-making around medications.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do we need to take inmates out for labs?</summary>
        <p>
          Some lab work may still require transport, but Aspen significantly
          reduces unnecessary medical transports by handling many issues through
          telehealth consultations.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do you see federal holds too?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes, Aspen provides medical care for all inmates in your facility
          regardless of their hold status or jurisdiction.
