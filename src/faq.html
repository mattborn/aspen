        <summary>Do we need special technology to use Aspen?</summary>
        <p>
          No. The main thing we need you to provide is a strong internet
          connection. We often work with pre-existing technology you already
          have for things like virtual court and also provide tablets and other
          technology as needed.
        </p>

        <summary>
          What happens when an inmate complains about a medical issue?
        </summary>
        <p>
          We provide training for your officers so they know exactly what to do
          when an inmate has a medical complaint. With 24/7 access, we’re always
          available to help your staff and provide medical guidance as needed.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What if our internet is unreliable?</summary>
        <p>
          Since this is a Telehealth first service, we do require that your
          facility has strong internet.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What kinds of medical services do you provide?</summary>
        <p>
          Aspen provides comprehensive medical care including daily nursing
          triage, weekly provider visits, weekly behavioral health sessions,
          24/7 on-call access, suicide-release evaluations, and ownership of
          administrative coordination as it relates to inmate healthcare.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can we keep our local nurse/provider?</summary>
        <p>
          Aspen is designed as a complete replacement for any on-site medical
          staff. In order to ensure consistent coverage and provide care
          consistent with our time-tested policies and procedures, we generally
          don’t have a local nurse or provider engaging in patient care. There
          are narrow exceptions, however.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do we still pay for medications?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Facilities are responsible for medication costs. However, Aspen’s
          corrections-specialized approach typically results in fewer overall
          medications prescribed in the jail environment. We often find inmates
          being prescribed medications that are inappropriate in the corrections
          setting when prescribed by outside, community providers.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          Do you offer part-time, in-person nursing or providers?
        </summary>
        <p>
          No. Aspen’s strength is our fully Telehealth model that provides 24/7
          coverage with corrections-specialized medical providers and without
          the vulnerabilities of part-time or on-site arrangements. For more on
          why Telehealth is an improvement for most small facilities

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          My jail is bigger than 100 beds, do you have services for larger
          jails?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Yes. While Aspen is meant for jails under 100 beds, our sister company
          Ivy Correctional Medicine is intended for jails over 100 beds. Contact
          <a href="mailto:sales@ivycm.com">sales@ivycm.com</a> for more
          information.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>
          What if I have more than 100 beds, but fewer than 80 inmates on
          average?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Aspen evaluates each facility based on average daily population, not
          bed count. If your ADP consistently stays around 80, we can discuss
          whether Aspen is a good fit.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What does this cost?</summary>
        <p>
          Pricing varies based on facility size and specific needs. Contact us
          for a quote.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What does implementation look like?</summary>
        <p>
          Implementation varies by county and state. Contact us for more
          information on what implementation looks like for you.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Who does MedPass?</summary>
        <p>
          Your facility staff continues to handle medication distribution. Aspen
          manages prescribing, medication review, and all clinical
          decision-making around medications as well as training for officers on
          best med pass best practices.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do we need to take inmates out for labs?</summary>
        <p>
          All lab work will need to be conducted offsite or via mobile
          phlebotomist service. During implementation we will work with you to
          identify the most convenient/cost effective solution and help you
          implement it. Our team will then manage the scheduling and
          coordination of lab work as needed.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do you see federal holds too?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Aspen provides medical care for all inmates inside the facility
          regardless of their hold status.
