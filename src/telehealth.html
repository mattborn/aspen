    <h1>Telehealth Isn’t a Compromise. For Small Jails, It’s an Upgrade.</h1>
    <p>
      On-site care models are fragile, expensive, and designed for facilities
      100–1,000 beds. Aspen’s telehealth approach delivers higher-quality care
      and more reliability with better results — all without leaving the jail.

      Most vendors treat small jails as “lite” versions of large ones. Aspen is
      different. This isn’t a scaled-down product — it’s a purpose-built model.

      We’ve worked with dozens of counties who thought the same thing — until
      they saw how Aspen’s telehealth model actually works.
