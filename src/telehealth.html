            Telehealth Isn't a Compromise. For Small Jails, It's an Upgrade.

          <p>
            Don't view telehealth as a "less than" experience, but designed to
            exceed your in-person healthcare approach versus higher-quality care
            you trusted during the pandemic—at a fraction of the cost.

                  <p>
                    A single nurse can be on-call 24/7, leading to turnover and
                    inadequate coverage during emergencies.

                  <p>
                    Hiring additional staff, getting them security trained, and
                    building clinical skills takes time—during which gaps in
                    care put everyone at risk.

                  <p>
                    Nurses with general medical experience often lack the
                    expertise to handle correctional challenges and inmate
                    manipulation.

                    You end up paying for overhead (benefits, training,
                    management) without getting true 24/7 coverage.

                  <p>
                    Large team ensures consistent coverage. We don't just have a
                    nurse "on call"—we have multiple corrections-specialized
                    providers immediately available.

                  <p>
                    Every provider understands jail environments and how to
                    handle manipulation, contraband concerns, and
                    custody-appropriate treatments.

                  <p>
                    No security risk involved. Provider staff and monitoring
                    don't need extensive security clearance since all care
                    happens remotely.

            Most vendors treat telehealth like it's a scaled-down product — it's
            a purpose-built model. We don't try to jam between intensive state
            contracts and small counties. You're not second-best — you're the
            target for what we designed the program for.
