        <h2>Why Small Jails Get Left Behind</h2>
        <p>If you run a jail with fewer than 80 beds, you already know this: most healthcare vendors won't even return your call—let alone solve your problems.</p>
        <div class="problems-grid">
          <div class="problem">
            <i class="fas fa-scale-balanced"></i>
            <h3>Cost Prohibitive</h3>
            <p>On-site care is often too expensive and you usually don't need a full time nurse.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
            <i class="fas fa-users"></i>
            <h3>Overlooked by Big Vendors</h3>
            <p>Large vendors prioritize the big facilities. Smaller jails just aren't their priority.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
            <i class="fas fa-heart-pulse"></i>
            <h3>Non-Corrections Clinicians</h3>
            <p>Community providers are frequently manipulated by inmates and prescribe unnecessary medications and treatments, generating burden for officers and extra costs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
            <i class="fas fa-address-book"></i>
            <h3>Patchwork Systems</h3>
            <p>If you don't have medical, your staff ends up triaging inmates and coordinating medical care on their own.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Burden -->
    <section id="burden">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Without the right medical team, the facility carries the burden.</h2>
        <div class="burden-grid">
          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Overloaded Officers</h4>
            <p>Officers get pulled off their core duties to manage transports, sit at ERs, and track down prescriptions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Increased Risk</h4>
            <p>Your people are making triage decisions without medical training — and if something goes wrong, the liability is yours.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Con Games</h4>
            <p>Inmates manipulate weaknesses in the system — gaming their way into transport or meds they don't need.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Too Many Meds, Too Much Risk</h4>
            <p>Community doctors often prescribe medications and treatments that aren't necessary in a jail setting. That leads to more pills, more cheeking, more risk, and more time spent on med pass.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Administrative Burden</h4>
            <p>Chasing down prescriptions, providers, and paperwork shouldn't fall on your jail staff. But it does.</p>

            <h3>A 24 hour medical partner</h3>
            <p>Instead of sending inmates out or guessing what to do, your staff can call Aspen. You've got backup and a real medical team taking responsibility.</p>

            <div class="timeline-marker">Week 1</div>
            <h3>Fewer transports, fewer disruptions</h3>
            <p>We start triaging complaints daily and seeing patients via telehealth. Many issues that used to trigger a trip to the hospital now get handled inside the jail.</p>

            <p>With consistent policies, fair boundaries, and caring but firm providers, the incentive to game the system drops dramatically. False complaints drop, and the tone in the facility starts to shift.</p>
