        <h2>Why Small Jails Get Left Behind</h2>
        <p>
          If you run a jail with fewer than 80 beds, you already know this: most
          healthcare vendors won't even return your call—let alone solve your
          problems.
        </p>
        <div class="problems-grid">
          <div class="problem">
            <i class="fas fa-scale-balanced"></i>
            <h3>Cost Prohibitive</h3>
            <p>
              On-site care is often too expensive and you usually don't need a
              full time nurse.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
            <i class="fas fa-users"></i>
            <h3>Overlooked by Big Vendors</h3>
            <p>
              Large vendors prioritize the big facilities. Smaller jails just
              aren't their priority.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
            <i class="fas fa-heart-pulse"></i>
            <h3>Non-Corrections Clinicians</h3>
            <p>
              Community providers are frequently manipulated by inmates and
              prescribe unnecessary medications and treatments, generating
              burden for officers and extra costs.
            </p>

            <i class="fas fa-address-book"></i>
            <h3>Patchwork Systems</h3>
            <p>
              If you don't have medical, your staff ends up triaging inmates and
              coordinating medical care on their own.

          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Overloaded Officers</h4>
            <p>
              Officers get pulled off their core duties to manage transports,
              sit at ERs, and track down prescriptions.
            </p>

          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Increased Risk</h4>
            <p>
              Your people are making triage decisions without medical training —
              and if something goes wrong, the liability is yours.
            </p>

          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Con Games</h4>
            <p>
              Inmates manipulate weaknesses in the system — gaming their way
              into transport or meds they don't need.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="burden-item">
            <h4>Too Many Meds, Too Much Risk</h4>
            <p>
              Community doctors often prescribe medications and treatments that
              aren't necessary in a jail setting. That leads to more pills, more
              cheeking, more risk, and more time spent on med pass.

            <h4>Administrative Burden</h4>
            <p>
              Chasing down prescriptions, providers, and paperwork shouldn't
              fall on your jail staff. But it does.

            <p>
              We start triaging complaints daily and seeing patients via

              We review prescriptions and eliminate inappropriate or unnecessary

              With consistent policies, fair boundaries, and caring but firm
