        <p>Don't view telehealth as a "less than" experience, but designed to exceed your in-person healthcare approach versus higher-quality care you trusted during the pandemic—at a fraction of the cost.</p>

              <div class="breakdown-item">
                <h4>On-Call Burnout</h4>
                <p>A single nurse can be on-call 24/7, leading to turnover and inadequate coverage during emergencies.</p>

              <div class="breakdown-item">
                <h4>Staffing Gaps Gap</h4>
                <p>Hiring additional staff, getting them security trained, and building clinical skills takes time—during which gaps in care put everyone at risk.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="breakdown-item">
                <h4>Inexperience in Corrections</h4>
                <p>Nurses with general medical experience often lack the expertise to handle correctional challenges and inmate manipulation.</p>

              <div class="benefit-item">
                <h4>24/7 Availability Without Burnout</h4>
                <p>Large team ensures consistent coverage. We don't just have a nurse "on call"—we have multiple corrections-specialized providers immediately available.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="benefit-item">
                <h4>Corrections-Specialized Staff</h4>
                <p>Every provider understands jail environments and how to handle manipulation, contraband concerns, and custody-appropriate treatments.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="benefit-item">
                <h4>Non-Security Risk Supervision</h4>
                <p>No security risk involved. Provider staff and monitoring don't need extensive security clearance since all care happens remotely.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="benefit-item">
                <h4>Guaranteed Service Levels</h4>
                <p>Contracted SLAs for response time and care quality. You're not dependent on one or two individuals.</p>

        <h2>Every System, Every Workflow, Every Policy: Designed for Jails Under 100 Beds</h2>
        <p>Most vendors treat telehealth like it's a scaled-down product — it's a purpose-built model. We don't try to jam between intensive state contracts and small counties. You're not second-best — you're the target for what we designed the program for.</p>
